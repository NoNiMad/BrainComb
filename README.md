# Brain Comb

A straightforward mind-mapping app with a focus on controlling (almost) everything from the keyboard and being able to customize a lot of things.

## Next steps

(somewhat in order of priority)
- Auto-save
- Undo/Redo
- Copy/Cut/Paste
- Multiple documents
- More customization
	- Settings
	- Node/branches coloring

## Known bugs

- Selecting an out-of-screen node does not move the view
